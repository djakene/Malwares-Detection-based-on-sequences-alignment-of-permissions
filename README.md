1- we first execute the training.py file by replacing in the file "path of apk" by the folder containing only the files "apk", "path of modelma.csv" by its path as well as for the one of "path of intmodel.csv"

2- secondly, we execute the file "threshold.py" by replacing the paths by their correspondents and possibly the thresholds chosen according to our convenience and according to the results obtained

3- we can finally test with the file "test.py" with the threshold of which we are convinced to be the best while replacing the paths.

Any improvement is welcome
